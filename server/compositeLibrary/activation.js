// server/compositeLibrary/activation.js
//
// D49a. The single place a compositeLibrary package is compiled, checked
// and made active.
//
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS AT ALL. Two callers now need identical behaviour:
//
//   1. Task Model promotion to `operational` (taskModelsRoutes.js) -- the
//      primary path, and what ADR 0003 means by "built at Task Model
//      activation".
//   2. POST /api/compositeLibrary/rebuild/:taskModelId (D48) -- the manual
//      escape hatch for a package that has gone stale.
//
// D48 wrote the compile/refuse/deactivate sequence inline in the rebuild
// route. Copying it into the promotion path would leave two definitions of
// what "activate a package" means, free to drift -- and a drift between two
// modules that independently decide which items are deliverable is exactly
// the quiet class of failure this project keeps finding (F4, G4, F6, and the
// D48 guard's own blind spot). One definition, two callers.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO: decide WHEN to activate. That is lifecycle
// policy and belongs to the routes. It also does not save; it mutates the
// passed `db` snapshot and lets the caller persist, so a promotion can write
// the Task Model and its package in one saveDB() rather than leaving a
// window where one landed and the other did not.

// Shared with no one: both callers now come through here, so the counter
// cannot collide the way two independent `genId`s in two route files would.
// Date.now() alone collides whenever two records are created inside the same
// millisecond, which a bulk promotion would do routinely.
