//
// Day 31 (Week 7): Evidence Accumulation (build reference Part 2, Step 26).
// Takes the Observable Variable values Evidence Identification produced
// (Day 27, stored on session.responses since Day 28) and applies the
// measurement model to update the Student Model Variable's DISTRIBUTION --
// an estimate AND its precision, never a bare point estimate.
//
// The build reference singles this file out as the highest-risk code in
// the system, at its highest effort tier, for one reason: "wrong posteriors
// look entirely plausible." A theta of 0.83 with an SE of 0.41 looks
// exactly as credible whether the math is right or wrong. Everything below
// is written on that assumption -- the arithmetic is conservative, every
// modelling assumption is named rather than implied, and every case this
// module cannot handle correctly returns an explicit `supported: false`
// rather than a number that would be believed.
//
// THREE DECISIONS WORTH READING BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING HERE
//
// 1. Parameters come from the parameter set the response was ACTUALLY
//    SCORED AGAINST (`response.parameterSetId`, recorded at submit time in
//    Day 28), not from whichever set happens to be active now. ADR 0003's
//    rule is that a calibrated value is resolved live by pointer and never
//    cached -- this honours that (the pointer is still resolved live) while
//    keeping the posterior REPRODUCIBLE from the stored responses alone. If
//    this read the currently-active set instead, recalibrating an Evidence
//    Model would silently change the historical estimate of every session
//    that ever used it, with no record that it had moved.
//
// 2. An observable's evidence-rule DIRECTION is honoured, not assumed.
//    A `supports` observable that activates is evidence of higher ability
//    (u=1); a `weakens` observable that activates is evidence of LOWER
//    ability (u=0), and vice versa. Treating every activation as u=1 -- the
//    obvious shortcut -- would silently invert the contribution of every
//    weakens-direction observable in the model. `neutral` carries no
//    directional information and is excluded rather than guessed at.
//
// 3. An unmatched response (`activated: null`, Day 27's "the work product
//    matched no declared pattern") is EXCLUDED, not scored as incorrect.
//    "We could not tell what this response means" and "the student got it
//    wrong" are different facts, and conflating them biases every estimate
//    downward in exactly the situations where the item bank is weakest.

/* QUADRATURE GRID SIZING -- Day 31, hardened after an adversarial pass.

   The obvious implementation (a fixed 41 points over a fixed [-4, 4]) is
   wrong in two directions, and both failures are silent:

   RESOLUTION. If the point COUNT is fixed while the range varies, the step
   size is uncontrolled. A competency model that declares a wide scale --
   say theta in [-100, 100], a perfectly reasonable authoring choice -- got
   a step of 5.0 against a prior SD of 1.0. Only a couple of nodes carried
   any mass at all, the recovered prior SD was 0.014 instead of 1.0, and a
   correct answer moved the estimate by 0.000 instead of 0.41. The grid is
   therefore sized by STEP, not by count: fine enough to resolve the prior
   (a quarter of its SD), with the count falling out of the range.

   COVERAGE. A grid that stops at +4 cannot represent a posterior centred
   past +4, and truncating one does not fail loudly -- it reports the edge
   as though it were the answer. Measured: 400 consecutive correct Rasch
   responses returned 3.90 +/- 0.15 where the true posterior is 4.55 +/-
   0.44. Both numbers are wrong, and the SD is wrong in the dangerous
   direction: a truncated posterior looks THREE TIMES more precise than the
   real one, because the tail that carries the uncertainty was cut off.
   So the grid is widened adaptively while meaningful mass sits on its
   boundary, and if it still does at the widest allowed span the result
   carries `boundaryLimited: true` rather than pretending to be a point
   measurement. */

   centred on an item of difficulty b = 5 can never be reached however many
   times the loop widens. Measured: a N(0, 0.1) prior with 1000 correct

       2. MODE AT THE BOUNDARY. For a normal prior the edge weights
          UNDERFLOW TO EXACTLY ZERO once the grid reaches ~40 SDs

       deliver any item whose Evidence Model had no active CALIBRATED
       parameter set, full stop. That made the whole dependency chain
       circular: R calibration needs a real response matrix (Part 0.2's
       diagram), a response matrix needs items to be deliverable, and items
       could not be delivered until calibration had already happened.
       sessionRoutes.js now lets a continuous-family item score against the
       Item Wizard's own pilot `psychometrics.irtParams` (Step 7) when no
       calibrated parameter set exists yet, tagging the response
       `parameterSource: "pilot"` instead of `"calibrated"`, and a
       raw-score-family item (CTT/sum/threshold) needs no parameter set at
       all -- it has never read one, `accumulateRawScoreFamily` below takes
       only Task Model weights -- so it is tagged `"not-applicable"`.
       A response predating this field carries neither `parameterSource`
       nor an absent `parameterSetId` together (the old gate guaranteed
       one), so it is treated as `"calibrated"` for backward compatibility.

       Responses in one group may in principle cite different parameter
       sets (a session that spanned a recalibration), or even mix pilot and
       calibrated evidence for the same Evidence Model (a session that
       started before a recalibration finished). Neither is silently
