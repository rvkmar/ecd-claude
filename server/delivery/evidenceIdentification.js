// Day 27 (Week 6): "Evidence Identification — the break that makes
// everything upstream inert" (build reference Part 2, Step 25). Applies
// an item's evidence-activation map against the bound evidence rule to
// turn a raw work product into an OBSERVABLE VARIABLE VALUE. The output
// is deliberately NOT a score, NOT a correct/incorrect flag, and NOT a
// point value -- Evidence Accumulation (Week 7-8) is where a measurement
// model turns this into a posterior update. Conflating the two here is
// exactly the bug Day 26's map found: SessionPlayer.jsx computes
// "correctness" client-side today by comparing a `correctOptionId` field
// questionsRoutes.js never writes, so every MCQ submission silently
// scores 0 regardless of the answer. This module replaces that
// comparison outright, not ports it.
//
// D49c: structural facts come from the ACTIVE compositeLibrary package
// for the item's Task Model (ADR 0003 / 0003a), not from a live re-walk
// of db.evidenceModels + item.scoring.evidenceActivationMap. A missing,
// inactive, or stale package is a REFUSAL, not a warning on a recorded
// null identification -- recording that would look like "the work
// product matched no pattern" and quietly drop the response. Calibrated
// parameters are still Accumulation's concern and are still resolved
// live from parameterSets[] (ADR 0003: never bake them in).
//
// Pure computation (no persistence), matching the style already
// established for compositeLibrary/builder.js and
// classicalCalibration.js: takes data in, returns data out.

/**
 * True if `pattern`'s keys all match the corresponding keys on
 * `workProduct`. Both the pattern's value and the work product's value are
 * normalized to arrays and compared for overlap ("any of these matches any
 * of those") -- so a single-value pattern against a single-value response
 * is an equality check (the common MCQ case, unchanged from the original
 * design), a multi-valued PATTERN against a single-value response is "any
 * of these" (`{ selected: ["opt_b","opt_c"] }` matches `selected: "opt_c"`
 * -- the literal shape samples/sample-items.json uses), and -- Day 30, an
 * adversarial-review finding -- a single-valued pattern against a
 * multi-select RESPONSE (`selected: ["opt_a","opt_c"]`) or a multi-valued
 * pattern against a multi-select response both now resolve by the same
 * overlap rule, rather than the multi-select response silently never
 * matching anything at all (arrays being compared by reference always
 * failed strict equality, and never appeared inside another array either).
 *
 * An empty pattern (`{}`, or no keys at all) NEVER matches, regardless of
 * work product. `Object.entries({}).every(...)` is vacuously true, which
 * would otherwise make an empty pattern match every possible response --
 * exactly the "matches everything and nothing" footgun this codebase
 * already flags for the authoring side (ecdVocabulary.js's
 * RESPONSE_PATTERN_FIELDS comments) but had not, before this check, guarded
 * against on the matching side too. Caught by an adversarial review of this
 * module (Day 27).
