// Day 57 (Week 12): the decision rule that turns a diagnostic posterior
// into a discrete mastery classification, with a stated threshold and a
// stated expected accuracy. This is the gap Day 40 named explicitly and
// the reason assemblyProgress.js has carried `stoppingCriterionMet: null`
// for every requiredClassificationAccuracy target since Day 34.
//
// Full reasoning: docs/adr/0004-mastery-classification-decision-rule.md.
// The five things worth knowing before changing anything here:
//
// 1. THE ACCURACY REPORTED HERE IS A CONDITIONAL, INDIVIDUAL QUANTITY.
//    `expectedClassificationAccuracy` is P(the class just assigned is the
//    true class | THIS examinee's responses). It is NOT the test's
//    population classification accuracy rate -- the index Wang et al.
//    (2015) and GDINA::CA() define, which integrates over the population
//    distribution of profiles and the whole response-pattern space. That
//    quantity is not a function of one session's data and therefore
//    cannot drive a stopping rule; it is deliberately not computed,
//    approximated or claimed anywhere in this module.
//
//    Averaging these individual numbers across a cohort does NOT recover
//    the population index. It yields the mean confidence of the
//    classifications actually made, biased upward wherever adaptive
//    selection stopped sessions early on the confident cases. D79's brief
//    already warns that averaging probabilities and counting
//    classifications answer different questions; this is that warning
//    applied to the accuracy column.
//
// 2. THE ACCURACY IS `master ? p : 1 - p`, NOT `max(p, 1 - p)`. The two
//    agree at threshold 0.5 and disagree everywhere else. An asymmetric
//    threshold IS an asymmetric loss function, and under one the rule can
//    deliberately assign the LESS probable class: at threshold 0.8 a
//    posterior of 0.7 classifies as nonmaster, and that decision is
//    correct with probability 0.3, not 0.7. `max()` would be right today
//    and quietly wrong the day threshold authoring lands. The general
//    form costs nothing and cannot rot.
//
// 3. AN EXACT TIE IS A REAL STATE. masteryPrior() in
//    attributeAccumulation.js returns {p: 0.5} whenever an SMV declares no
//    prior, so exactly 0.5 is a value this pipeline produces on purpose,
//    not a floating-point accident. `p > tau ? "master" : "nonmaster"`
//    would silently report "has not mastered" for an attribute whose
//    evidence is exactly balanced. Attributes no response touched are
//    already excluded upstream (supported: false), so "indeterminate"
//    means measured-and-balanced, never unmeasured.
//
// 4. ONLY A MASTERY POSTERIOR MAY BE CLASSIFIED. The caller must gate on
//    `method === "attribute-mastery-posterior"`; isClassifiablePosterior()
//    here is that gate. An "eap" estimate is theta on the real line. A
//    "weighted-proportion" estimate is an observed proportion of score in
//    [0, 1] -- bounded exactly like a probability, and not one. That
//    second case is authorable TODAY: RAW_SCORE_SMV_TYPES includes
//    "binary", and schema.js REQUIRES requiredClassificationAccuracy on a
//    binary SMV, so a binary SMV carrying a CTT/sum/threshold model
//    produces precisely this collision through entirely valid records.
//    Gating on smvType instead would reproduce the Day 39 adversarial
//    review's P1-6 finding on this side of the module.
//
// 5. NOTHING HERE IS PERSISTED. A classification is a pure function of a
//    stored posterior and a stated threshold. Storing it would create a
//    second source of truth that can drift from the posterior it came
//    from, and would cut against the reproducibility invariant D68
//    re-verifies. D79 recomputes from stored posteriors through this same
//    module, which is only sound because there is exactly one
//    implementation of the rule.
