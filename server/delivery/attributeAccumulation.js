// server/delivery/attributeAccumulation.js
//
// Day 36 (Week 8): the binary-attribute-mastery branch of Evidence
// Accumulation -- DINA and G-DINA. Where the continuous branch
// (evidenceAccumulation.js) updates ONE latent ability from an item
// response function over theta, this updates a JOINT distribution over
// 2^K attribute-mastery profiles and reports the marginal mastery
// probability of each attribute separately.
//
// The near-term DINA requirement (build reference Part 0.3) is why
// Evidence Accumulation had to dispatch per model family from its first
// line rather than being written for IRT and generalised later. This file
// is what that dispatch was reserved for.
//
// It carries the same standard the continuous branch was held to, for the
// same reason: a mastery probability of 0.83 looks exactly as credible
// whether the math is right or wrong. Every case that cannot be computed
// correctly returns an explicit refusal rather than a number.
//
// FIVE DECISIONS WORTH READING BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING HERE
//
// 1. PARAMETERS ARE KEYED BY ITEM, NOT BY OBSERVABLE. This diverges from
//    the IRT branch, deliberately. A Q-matrix is an items x attributes
//    matrix -- `qMatrixModels.entries[]` is `{itemId, attributeId}` (Day
//    18), so an item's Q-vector is item-scoped by construction. The DINA
//    response function P(X=1 | alpha) is a function of BOTH the Q-vector
//    and (slip, guess) together, so those parameters must live at the same
//    granularity as the Q-vector or the two can disagree. Two items
//    sharing one observable have different Q-vectors and therefore need
//    different slip/guess; keying them by observable would silently force
//    them to share. This also matches the DINA literature, where s_j and
//    g_j are per-item throughout.
//
// 2. THE PRIOR ASSUMES ATTRIBUTE INDEPENDENCE; THE POSTERIOR DOES NOT.
//    Competency models declare a prior per binary SMV, one at a time --
//    there is nowhere to author a joint distribution over profiles, and
//    inventing correlations that nobody stated would be a fabrication. So
//    the prior is the product of the marginals. The POSTERIOR is computed
//    over all 2^K profiles jointly and only then marginalised, so the
//    dependence the data induces between attributes is preserved. This is
//    the standard independence-prior starting point, and it is an
//    assumption, not a derivation -- it is stated here because it is
//    invisible in the output.
//
// 3. A ZERO PROBABILITY IS NOT CLAMPED, unlike the continuous branch.
//    There, log(0) arose from a logistic function SATURATING in floating
//    point, so clamping recovered the intended value. Here, P(X=1 | alpha)
//    = 0 is an exact modelling statement: with guess = 0, a student
//    lacking the required attributes cannot answer correctly, so observing
//    a correct answer genuinely rules those profiles out. Clamping would
//    silently soften a deterministic constraint the author wrote on
//    purpose. If the data rules out EVERY profile -- which is possible,
//    and means the responses are impossible under the calibrated model --
//    that is refused explicitly rather than normalised into noise.
//
// 4. DINA MONOTONICITY IS ENFORCED; G-DINA MONOTONICITY IS NOT. DINA
//    requires guess < 1 - slip: a student who has every required attribute
//    must be likelier to succeed than one who has none. Violating it
//    inverts the item, exactly as a negative IRT discrimination did (a
//    defect the Day 31 adversarial review caught reporting theta = -2.21
//    for twenty CORRECT answers). A SATURATED G-DINA is a different
//    matter -- non-monotonic estimates are legitimate output there and
//    the package that produced them did not treat them as errors -- so
//    those are surfaced as a warning, not a refusal.
//
// 5. THE REDUCED-PATTERN ORDERING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN, and it matters more
//    than it looks. See REDUCED_PATTERN_ORDER below.

/* Cost bound, not a modelling claim -- mirrors MAX_GRID_POINTS in the
   continuous branch. The posterior is computed over all 2^K profiles, so
   the work doubles per attribute: K=12 is 4,096 profiles per response,
   K=20 would be a million. A Q-matrix wider than this is refused with a
   reason rather than silently hanging a request. */
const MAX_ATTRIBUTES = 12;

/* The canonical index of an item's REDUCED attribute pattern -- the
   sub-vector of only the attributes that item requires -- used to look up
   a saturated G-DINA probability.

   Getting this backwards does not throw. It permutes the probability
   table, so a well-calibrated item quietly answers with another pattern's
   probability, and every posterior downstream is plausible and wrong.

   *** DAY 37 RESOLUTION: NEITHER LITTLE-ENDIAN NOR BIG-ENDIAN. ***

   Day 36 left this as a straight little-endian-vs-big-endian bit question
   ("is the first required attribute the least or most significant bit?").
   That framing was wrong on both sides. GDINA's `attributepattern()` (and
   the internal `alpha2()` it calls for a purely dichotomous, non-Q-matrix
   K) does not walk a binary counter at all -- it groups profiles by the
   NUMBER of mastered attributes (Hamming weight) ascending, and within
   each weight class, by the standard lexicographic order of the mastered
   attributes' positions. For K=2 this happens to coincide with a
   little-endian binary counter ([00, 10, 01, 11] either way), which is
   almost certainly why the Day 36 review's recollection framed this as a
   bit-order question -- the two-attribute case cannot distinguish "binary
   counting" from "graded lexicographic" at all. They diverge starting at
   K=3: a naive little-endian counter over (a0,a1,a2) visits
   000,100,010,110,001,101,011,111, while GDINA visits
   000,100,010,001,110,101,011,111 -- patterns 3 and 4 are swapped, and
   the gap widens with K.

   THIS WAS VERIFIED, NOT RECOLLECTED. R is still not installed in this
   environment, but its absence is no longer an excuse: R (r-base-core)
   was installed, and the actual GDINA source (github.com/cran/GDINA, the
   official CRAN read-only mirror, v2.9.12) was cloned rather than trusted
   from memory. `attributepattern(K, Q)` (R/ExportedFuncs.R) calls the
   compiled `alpha2(K)` for the dichotomous case, implemented in
   src/util.cpp using `combnCpp` (also in src/util.cpp) to enumerate each
   weight class in lexicographic order. Both were extracted verbatim,
   compiled standalone with Rcpp/RcppArmadillo, and RUN:

     alpha2(2) -> 00,10,01,11                     (matches a binary counter)
     alpha2(3) -> 000,100,010,001,110,101,011,111 (a binary counter would
                                                     give ...,010,110,001,...)
     alpha2(4) -> confirms the same weight-then-lex pattern at K=4

   So: attributes still appear in the order the Q-matrix's own
   `attributeIds[]` declares them (that part of the Day 36 convention was
   right), but the INDEX within an item's 2^m-row table is the
   weight-then-lexicographic rank computed by `reducedPatternIndex` below,
   not a positional bit-sum. DINA remains unaffected either way, since eta
   is a conjunction and so order-free -- only the G-DINA branch reads
   `reducedPatternIndex`'s return value as a table index. */

     An entry whose `required` is present and falsy is an explicitly
     declared ZERO cell, not a required attribute -- a Q-matrix is a 0/1
     matrix and this flag is how a 0 is written down. Tested for falsiness
     rather than `=== false` because a numeric 0 is the natural encoding of
     a zero cell coming out of a CSV or an R export, and `required: 0`
     reading as "required" would invert the cell's meaning.

     SORTED, and this is load-bearing rather than tidiness. The reduced-
     pattern index (see REDUCED_PATTERN_ORDER) is defined over the
     attributes in `attributeIds[]` order. Building it in `entries[]` order
     instead makes the bit order depend on the sequence cells happened to
     be authored in -- and nothing constrains that: schema.js validates an
     entries array in any order as entirely valid, and a cell-clicking
     Q-matrix editor produces click order by default. An adversarial review
     measured the consequence: with the same Q-matrix authored in two entry
     orders, two attributes' mastery probabilities were EXCHANGED (0.914 /
     0.571 becoming 0.571 / 0.914), silently and with `supported: true`,
     and per-attribute classification accuracy over 2,000 simulated
     students fell from 94.9% to 90.3%. DINA is immune because eta is a
     conjunction and so order-free, which is exactly why the DINA/G-DINA
