// server/delivery/activitySelection.js
//
// D56 (Week 12): Activity Selection -- Step 23 of the ECD delivery cycle,
// and the last box in Fig. 12's loop to be built. Evidence Identification
// (Day 28), Evidence Accumulation (Day 34) and the Assembly Model targets
// (Day 17 / D54) all existed; the arrow from Accumulation BACK to Activity
// Selection did not. This module is that arrow.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Until D56 the three selection strategies
// lived inline in sessionRoutes.js's GET /:id/next-task handler, and read
// `db.questions` -- the LEGACY question bank -- directly. That predates
// items, the composite library, Evidence Models and posteriors entirely.
// sessionRoutes.js's own Day 28 comment says so in as many words:
// "/next-task's item-based selection is a separate, larger Activity
// Selection undertaking, not attempted here." D40's handoff carried the
// same gap forward: "the existing selection policies still read
// db.questions directly and are unaffected by Weeks 7-8 -- they have not
// been re-pointed at the composite library or at current SMV beliefs."
//
// WHAT "READS THE LIBRARY" MEANS HERE. A candidate's structural facts come
// from the ACTIVE compositeLibrary package for its Task Model (compiled at
// Task Model activation, per ADR 0003), not from re-walking
// taskModel -> items -> evidenceModels at request time. Item PARAMETERS are
// deliberately NOT in the package -- ADR 0003 excludes them precisely so
// recalibration takes effect immediately -- so they are resolved live, by
// pointer, exactly as the scoring path does. See resolveContinuousParameters
// and resolveDinaParameters below, and the agreement test that pins them to
// sessionRoutes.js's own choices.
//
// WHAT "READS THE LIVE POSTERIOR" MEANS HERE. `session.studentModel
// .smvPosteriors` -- written by applyPosteriorsToSession() on every submit.
// NOT `session.studentModel.irtTheta`, which only the legacy R-backend
// branch ever writes, and not `bnPosteriors`, which nothing writes at all
// (see F24 below).
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE LEGACY QUESTION PATH IS QUARANTINED, NOT DELETED.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// D56's unit text says "retire the direct db.questions reads." Taken
// literally that would strand every existing question-based session with no
// migration: IRT selection over `db.questions` is the ONLY selection those
// sessions have. D47 set the precedent for exactly this situation -- "the
// legacy path is unchanged and still passes its own tests" -- and
// sessionRoutes.js's ITEM_DELIVERY_ENABLED flag is the same idea. So: the
// item path never touches `db.questions`, the legacy branch below is the
// single remaining reader, it is clearly marked, and it is reached only by
// a task that names a `questionId` and no `itemId`. When the legacy path is
// finally retired, deleting `selectLegacyQuestionCandidate` is the whole job.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// F24 -- FOUND WHILE BUILDING THIS UNIT. The BayesianNetwork strategy has
// never once run its own algorithm.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// The pre-D56 branch gated every Evidence Model on
// `em.measurementModel?.type !== "BayesianNetwork"`. `measurementModel`
// appears NOWHERE in src/utils/schema.js, in samples/, or in any seed data,
// and nothing in the codebase writes it -- Evidence Models carry
// `statisticalModels[]`, and have since the schema was written. So the
// guard's `continue` fired for every model, every time; `gain` stayed 0 for
// every candidate; and because `bestGain` started at `-Infinity`, `0 >
// -Infinity` handed the win to the FIRST unanswered task. The strategy was
// "pick the first unanswered task" wearing an information-gain costume.
// `session.studentModel.bnPosteriors`, the prior it would have read, is
// likewise written by nothing in production -- its only assignment anywhere
// is a test fixture -- so even with the field renamed every prior would
// have been the `?? 0.5` default.
//
// A latent second defect in the same dead branch, recorded so it is not
// reintroduced: it weighted the two outcomes of a hypothetical response by a
// hardcoded 0.5 each (`0.5 * entropy(post1) + 0.5 * entropy(post0)`) rather
// than by their actual marginal probabilities. That is not expected entropy;
// it systematically misprices any item whose success probability is far from
// a half. computeExpectedInformationGain below weights by P(u=1) and P(u=0).
//
// WHAT THIS UNIT DID ABOUT IT. Re-pointed the strategy at the diagnostic
// machinery that actually exists and actually produces live beliefs:
// attributeAccumulation.js's per-attribute mastery posteriors (DINA/G-DINA,
// keyed by Q-matrix attribute, landing in `smvPosteriors`). Where a session
// carries no diagnostic data at all, the strategy DEGRADES to first-
// unanswered -- which is what it has always actually done -- and says so in
// `debug.reason` rather than presenting an accidental default as a
// computed choice.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// * It does not decide a mastery CLASSIFICATION itself. Day 57 built that
//   rule in attributeClassification.js and assemblyProgress.js applies it,
//   so a requiredClassificationAccuracy target now arrives here as a real
//   boolean. The `targetsMet` filter then requires EVERY declared
//   targetsBySMV entry to have such a row and to be `true` -- an SMV that
//   never accumulated a posterior is not "vacuously met". What still
//   arrives as `null` is a target nobody could evaluate: a classification
//   target against a posterior that is not a mastery probability, or a SEM
//   target on an incomparable scale. null is still not true, and still
//   never stops a session.
// * It does not override the session's own `selectionStrategy` with the
//   Assembly Model's `selectionAlgorithm` pointer. A mismatch between the
//   two is reported as a warning. D49a's own open decision settled this
//   shape for this project: refuse or advise, never act quietly.
// * It does not persist anything. Pure computation over a db snapshot plus
//   the session, matching compositeLibrary/builder.js and every other
//   module in server/delivery/.
// * It does not change the CRITERION the IRT strategy optimises. Today's
//   criterion is "difficulty closest to the current ability estimate", and
//   that is preserved exactly -- only its INPUTS move (library + live
//   posterior + live-resolved parameters). Maximum Fisher information is
//   the better CAT criterion and is the obvious next step, but swapping it
//   in is a psychometric change whose failure mode is quiet, and it belongs
//   in a unit that verifies against a published benchmark (D64-D70), not
//   in a re-pointing unit.
