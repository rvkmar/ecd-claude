// @vitest-environment node

//
// This is the single most important test file from the Phase 1 security
// pass: it asserts that every route file which previously had ZERO
// authentication now rejects a request with no token. If a future change
// (Phase 2's data-layer consolidation, or anything else) accidentally
// removes or reorders the `router.use(authenticateToken)` line added to
// each of these files, this test fails immediately instead of the gap
// being rediscovered by re-auditing the whole codebase again.
//
// Each router's own business logic (schema validation, lifecycle rules,
// etc.) is NOT exercised here — only the auth boundary. That's deliberate:
// this file's only job is "does a request with no token get rejected
// before it reaches any route handler."

// Static top-level imports on purpose. Under a WSL full-suite run that
// creates jsdom 61 times, a mid-suite cold dynamic import of reportsRoutes
// alone can exceed a 30s beforeAll hookTimeout even after caching one
// importer() per describe. Loading every protected router here moves that
// cost to file evaluation — once, before any hook clock starts — so this
// file stays a static auth-boundary check. hookTimeout does not apply to
// module evaluation; if a worker ever looks hung it is collection-time
// load under contention, not a failed 401/403 assertion. Do not swap
// these back to importer() / beforeAll, and do not "fix" a slow collect
// by bumping hookTimeout alone.
