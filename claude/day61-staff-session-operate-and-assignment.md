# D61 — Staff Play/Pause/Operate, session assignment, /mine leftover

**Status: CLOSED.** User feedback after PR #12 (staff Play routing) and PR #13 (`sessionPlay.js` `.js` specifier). Teacher Play no longer logs out. The remaining bugs were list UX, create-form assignment, and My Sessions still able to surface `Session not found`.

Not the never-compress D60 (selection/stopping review). This file is the D50 leftover close that #12/#13 did not finish.

## Root causes

### A — Staff Play / Pause

Sessions were created as `in_progress`. `canPauseSession` then rendered **Play and Pause together**. Play still `navigate()`d into `SessionPlayer` (finish / “no more tasks”), so staff could not stay on the list or run multiple sessions. Pause already called `POST /pause`, but the exclusive-button + persist-on-the-list contract was missing.

### B — Create session student picker

`/api/students` is the authoring roster (`stu…`). It is usually empty: writes are admin-only and seed accounts live in `users` (`stud1`). The form was a single `<select>` of that roster, with no “Student with ID” and no cohort. Assignment never wrote a username `/mine` could match.

### C — Student My Sessions `Session not found`

PR #13 fixed the Node ESM specifier so `GET /mine` can register. Remaining holes:

1. If `/mine` still failed to register (stale process, another load error), `GET /:id` with `id=mine` returned `{ error: "Session not found" }`.
2. The client treated that 404 as a fatal alert (`Could not load sessions: Session not found`) instead of an empty list.
3. Create never persisted `stud1` / `studentIds[]`, so even a healthy `/mine` had nothing assigned (fallback-to-all-live is not the same as a real assignment).

Empty list + empty-state is OK. That error string is not.

## What changed

- Create starts sessions as `ready`. **Play** → `POST /:id/play` → `in_progress` (stays on the list). **Pause** → `POST /:id/pause`. **Operate** opens the role-prefixed player. Play and Pause are mutually exclusive.
- SessionPlayer has **Back to sessions** (`/${role}`) and does not finish the session. Student examinee Play still opens the player.
- `GET /api/students/assignable` merges roster + student-role users. Form: multi-select, **Student with ID**, cohort. POST creates one session per assignee with `studentId` + `studentIds`.
- `GET /mine` never 404s. `GET /:id` returns `[]` for reserved names (`mine`, `active`, `archived`). Student list treats `Session not found` as empty.

Teacher and District share `SessionBuilder` / `SessionList`.

## How to verify (Docker: teach1 / dist1 / stud1)

1. Log in as **teach1**. Sessions → New Session. Add ID `stud1` (or pick from assignable). Save. Row is **Ready** with **Play** only.
2. Play → status **In Progress**, **Pause** + **Operate**, still on the list. Pause → **Play** only. Play again → Operate.
3. Operate → player. **Back to sessions** returns to the list; session stays in progress. Repeat from **dist1**.
4. Log in as **stud1** → My Sessions. Expect the assigned session or the empty-state sentence — not `Could not load sessions: Session not found`.
