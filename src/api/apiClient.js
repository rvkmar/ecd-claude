           "details": ["An IRT-scored item must carry at least
                        discrimination (a) and difficulty (b) ..."] }

     So "Send to review" surfaced only the headline -- "Item lifecycle
     validation failed." -- and dropped the one sentence that said what to
     do about it. The Server-preflight panel rendered `details` correctly
     because it reads the response body itself, which is exactly the
     inconsistency: two renderings of the same failure, one useful.

     Reading it here fixes every call site at once -- toasts, the modals
     and the wizard context all funnel through this function. */
