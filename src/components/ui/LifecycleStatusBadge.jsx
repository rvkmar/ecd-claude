// src/components/ui/LifecycleStatusBadge.jsx
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// One status badge for every model layer's Operate tab.
//
// There used to be four of these, and three disagreed with
// server/utils/lifecycleMatrix.js:
//   • CompetencyModelList rendered a BINARY badge -- locked ? "Confirmed"
//     : "Draft" -- so a `reviewed` model was labelled "Draft", flatly
//     contradicting the Review button sitting next to it.
//   • EvidenceModelList had its own colour ladder with no `reviewed`
//     branch, so a reviewed model fell through to the draft yellow.
//   • ItemBuilder had a third palette again (reviewed = yellow-200).
// Only TaskModelList used STATUS_BADGE_CLASSES.
//
// The matrix owns the palette; this component owns the shape.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
