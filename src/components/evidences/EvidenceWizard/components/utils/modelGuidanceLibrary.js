       total over the observables, interpreted against a cut score or
       a norm, with reliability (and the standard error of measurement
       it implies) as the quality claim rather than item parameters.

       Distinct from the Sum Score model below, which is the same
       arithmetic with no measurement claim attached: `sum` is a
       deterministic aggregation rule, `ctt` carries a score scale, a
       reliability target and an SEM, and is calibrated against a
       response matrix.
