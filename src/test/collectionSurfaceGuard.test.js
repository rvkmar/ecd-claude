// src/test/collectionSurfaceGuard.test.js
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// D48. Guards artefacts 4 and 6 of the seven-artefact contract at the
// COLLECTION level: every collection declared in schema.js must have a
// mounted HTTP surface and a declared role permission.
//
// The bug this exists to prevent has already happened three times over.
// `assemblyModels` (Day 17), `qMatrixModels` (Day 18) and
// `compositeLibrary` (Day 19) each shipped with a full schema block,
// referential-integrity checks and — for two of them — a lifecycle
// validator, and then sat for weeks with no route file, no
// rolePermissions entry and no query hooks. They could be validated but
// not reached. Nothing failed, because nothing was looking.
//
// It is the same shape as the Day 13 finding (itemsRoutes.js shipped
// with no role gating at all while rolePermissions.js had no `items`
// entry), one level up: there, a surface existed with no declared
// permission; here, a declared entity had no surface at all.
//
// Like every other guard in this repo, this must be verified to FAIL
// when the thing it protects is removed — delete a route file, or an
// app.use() line, and this test should go red.
