/* ============================================================
   D49b — NOTHING IS DONE UNTIL SOMETHING CALLS IT
   ============================================================

   Action plan §8: "A module with no caller is not shipped work. Enforced by
   a dead-export guard test -- F4 and G4 are the same bug, found eight weeks
   apart." G4 shipped `record-usage` with no caller and every exposure figure
   was permanently zero. F4 shipped `buildCompositeLibrary()` with no caller
   and the delivery package was a design artefact for five weeks.

   THREE DESIGN DECISIONS, each of which the guard is useless without:

   1. TEST FILES DO NOT COUNT AS CALLERS. This is the whole point, not an
      implementation detail. F4's own description reads: "exercised by its own
      tests -- and invoked from nowhere in server/ or src/". A guard whose
      caller corpus included test files would have seen buildCompositeLibrary
      in builder.test.js and passed it. The bug this guard exists to catch is
      precisely "well tested, never called".

   2. SCOPED TO server/. Measured at 71e69a0: 11 dead exports under server/,
      153 under src/. The src/ figure is dominated by React Query hooks built
      ahead of the screens that consume them -- useQMatrixModels,
      useCompositeLibrary and friends shipped on D48 with no UI yet BY DESIGN,
      because the seven-artefact contract requires the hooks and the build
      reference schedules the screens for W11. A guard that failed on all 153
      would be switched off within a day. Revisit a client-side guard after
      W11, when the screens exist.

   3. BASELINED, NOT CLEANED FIRST. The 11 below are recorded with reasons and
      the guard fails only on NEW ones, so it is useful today rather than
      after a cleanup. The baseline is also checked in the other direction: an
      entry that has ACQUIRED a caller must be removed, or the list rots into
      a place where dead code hides.

/* A COMMENTED-OUT CALL IS NOT A CALL.
   This repo has already shipped this exact bug once: the D48 collection
   surface guard matched `// router.use(authenticateToken)` and passed a
   mutation it should have failed. The same trap is live here in the other
   direction — if the caller corpus is raw text, commenting out the last real
   call site leaves the export looking alive, and the guard goes quiet at
   precisely the moment it should fire.

   Stripping can only ever REMOVE text, so its failure mode is a false
   "dead" (loud, reviewed) rather than a false "alive" (silent). That is the
   correct direction for a guard to be wrong in. */
