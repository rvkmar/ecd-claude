// safe test value has to exist before those imports run. Vitest loads
// setupFiles as their own module graph and fully evaluates them before it
// imports the actual test file, so setting these here — rather than at the

// A minimal no-op stub is standard practice for this exact gap (Radix's
// own test suite ships one) -- nothing under test here reads actual
// measured sizes, only that mounting/interacting doesn't throw.
