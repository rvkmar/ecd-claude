// Settings > Bulk Upload. Six independent JSON importers, one per entity
// type, per the user's explicit decisions:
//   - format: JSON array of full entity objects for all six
//   - no cross-entity smart ordering: each uploader just replays the
//     single-create validation/logic per row (see the server/routes/*.js
//     createXRecord() helpers each endpoint below calls into)

          rules as creating it one at a time, with one relaxation specific to importing: a parent
          referenced here may itself still be a draft, so a whole authored chain can land in one
          sitting. A row whose parent doesn't exist at all still fails just that row, and
          confirming any record still enforces the full confirmed+locked chain.
